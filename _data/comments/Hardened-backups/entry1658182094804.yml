message: "That's a good idea! I also like keeping my files in [storage spaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/overview) with redundant drives so when one of your drives dies you can keep going.\r\n\r\nSince writing this article, I picked up a Synology DS220+ NAS for about $300 on Amazon. That's a good centralized location for people in your household to back up files to. Plus it can do lots of other fun home-server stuff, like block all the ads in your house."
