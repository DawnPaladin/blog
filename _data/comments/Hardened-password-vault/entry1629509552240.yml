  Thanks for this James, there is a lot of value in seeing and knowing this will
  work how you would expect it too.  This setup has an added benefit that you
  don't really need put your trust in the potentially variable security of
  someone else's server.  A lot of my friends have not gone through the one time
  effort of setting up a password manager, and password reuse is a huge problem,
  I hope this helps!
