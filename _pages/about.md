Hi, I'm James. I'm a designer and web developer in Texas. This blog hasn't yet decided what it wants to be when it grows up. Until I get a proper description in place, [here are some websites I've made](https://jamesharris.design/), and [you can read more of my writing here](http://www.dawnpaladin.com/).

As a writer, I believe one of the worst things you can do is waste the reader's time. That means this blog goes long stretches without an update if I don't have anything worth saying. Please subscribe via email or RSS to be notified when there's a new post.

If you found value in something I wrote, please share it with your friends!
