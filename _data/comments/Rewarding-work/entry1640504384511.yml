message: "Eloquent and erudite, as usual. You have a genuine gift for taking complex subjects and rendering them manageable without neglecting their essential natures in the process, and you use that gift well. Thank you.\r\n\r\nYour preview of your next topic randomly reminded me of Sun Tsu's famous adage: \"No plan survives contact with the enemy\" :-) Perhaps a less-militaristic version of this can be found in the old saying, \"Man plans, and God laughs\" :-) The plan we find along the way is typically the \"real\" plan, while the earlier version seems like more of a premise, in hindsight. Thanks again, my friend, for using your rigorous intellect so admirably! M."
