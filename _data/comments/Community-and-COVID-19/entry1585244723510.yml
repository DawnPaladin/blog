  I absolutely love the way you've set this up, James. It's more like the print
  version of a news and events program than the pages of dense prose that blogs
  used to be about. Also, my past writing teachers always used to say, "Your
  opening line should grab attention", and yours certainly does here. Superior
  work in all aspects. I'm very proud of you, my friend!
