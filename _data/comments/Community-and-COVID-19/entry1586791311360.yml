  Great work James! It was a fun read, something that makes the terror of these
  times more palatable. I would make the comment that we don't yet have
  apocalypse type war gangs forming because there is STILL food in the shopping
  centers. If the supply chain breaks down i will be coming back to the blog for
  an update :) All around great work, i look forward to the next one.
