  Much of life's fulfillment comes not in self-pursuit of self-fulfillment,
  self-enrichment, self-centered, self-actualized selfishness, but in a life
  stride of laying down one's life for those we love.  It is amazing how much
  joy comes not from the single-minded search for the optimum me but in choosing
  to serve loved ones and being nested in a community that values doing that for
  each other.  Families down through the generations have been the setting to
  pass along how to do this well (or badly); families that practice sacrificing
  self on behalf of each other are the beginning point of civilizations that
  thrive.  Families that jettison one another for the sake of selfish desire are
  the beginning point of civilizations that fracture and fall.  Laying down our
  life for our friends, knowing they'd do the same for us, that's very
  relational, a fulfillment and sense of cherishing life at a level out of reach
  to those seeking self fulfillment all alone (or worse, at the expense of
  others).\r\n\r\n
  
  In short, much of work's joy can happen in the relationships found
  there no matter what the work itself is. Much of the joy at home is found not
  primarily in pursuing self pleasing but alongside of and on behalf of meeting
  the needs of others. Loving others and being loved by others is a core quality
  of life.  Which is why a love relationship with God is the one foundation
  stable enough for everything else. As a Christian parent, I know what it means
  to have it settled that I would lay down my life for my kids. That's both
  because I love them more than my own life and because I know mortal life is
  not all the life I have.  Being immortal and connected to the source of life
  and love make fulfillment only truly possible by discarding the fantasy that
  self-fulfillment is a primary goal in life; it is not.  It is a byproduct of
  giving up one's self, to God and to those He has entrusted to me. Amazingly,
  those things He made me to do well find expression along the way, and joy is
  there, too.
