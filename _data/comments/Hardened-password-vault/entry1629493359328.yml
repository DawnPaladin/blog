  @Tom Thanks for commenting! I don't think the EFF has a recommendation for a
  cloud-based password manager; KeePass is the only password manager in [their
  list of tool guides](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module-categories/tool-guides). I
  have heard good things about [1Password](https://1password.com/) and
  [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).
