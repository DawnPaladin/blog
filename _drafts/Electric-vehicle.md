## Introduction

I've always been a computer guy, not a car guy. But as cars get more computers in them and get more high-tech, they get more interesting to me, and the rise of electric vehicles has been very interesting indeed. Electric vehicles are innovating at a smartphone-like cadence -- every year sees major improvements in range and charging speed. In January of 2014, after extensive research, I decided to take the plunge and buy an electric vehicle. This post will share my research, the results, and my recommendations for those considering buying their own EV.

I should begin by cautioning the reader about the information environment surrounding EVs. Energy is big business. Cars are big business. Both of these topics have big political implications, so you should expect to encounter misinformation surrounding them. In addition to the political spin, details about EVs can be pretty technical and can also change as the technology rapidly evolves, so even normally-trustworthy general-purpose sources like _Consumer Reports_ sometimes get important things wrong.

## Should I buy an EV?

### Operating cost

The most important determinant of whether you'll be happy with an EV is your charging situation. First, will you be able to install a charger where you park your EV every night? If you own your home, the answer is probably yes. If you live in an apartment complex, the answer is probably no, unless you can persuade the owners to install one.

Second, what kind of rates does your electric utility provide for off-peak electricity? My electric co-op provides an incredibly good deal in this regard. My first month of driving after we got everything installed cost me about $7.50 in electricity. Later on, when a home disaster wrecked our kitchen and forced us to drive to restaurants for most of our meals, our consumption rose to $15/month. For comparison, before buying our EV, we would commonly spend $150 a month on gas. The difference between driving out to buy expensive tanks of gasoline versus easy charging at home is night and day, because buying electricity at night is so cheap.

Here's the formula for figuring out how much driving an EV would cost you, relative to what you're paying for gasoline right now.

Gas cost = gas price ($/gal) / MPG (mi/gal) * miles
Electric cost = electric rate ($/kwhr) / (mi/kwhr) * miles

Okay, that covers cost of fuel/energy. Before I finish talking about operating cost, it's time for acronyms!

### Plug-in hybrids, and their tradeoffs

These three acronyms describe the three major categories of electric and non-electric vehicles:

- **ICE:** Internal Combustion Engine. This is a purely gasoline-powered vehicle.
- **BEV:** Battery Electric Vehicle. This is a purely electric vehicle.
- **PHEV:** Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle. This is both. Plug it in and it will run on electricity for short trips; for long trips it runs on gasoline just like an ICE car.

PHEVs seem like the best of both worlds, right? They are - you can take short trips around town on cheap electricity, and you don't have to worry about range. But BEVs have one big advantage: they are mechanically very simple. A BEV never needs an oil change, never needs a transmission replaced, never needs new spark plugs or engine filters or timing belts. It's just an enormous battery and a pair of electric motors mounted to the wheels. Due to the weight of the battery and the superior torque of the electric motor, EVs do go through tires somewhat faster; I am told this can be alleviated somewhat by using EV-specific tires, but I haven't researched the topic in depth. Regardless, BEVs are **much cheaper to operate** than ICEs or PHEVs.

The tradeoff is that BEVs have limited range before they need a recharge. This isn't a huge problem, in my view. At this point enough EV chargers have been built that you can find them in towns above a certain size along most major freeways. My EV can drive at freeway speeds for a little over 3 hours before it needs to recharge for an hour or so while I get some food and stretch my legs. You can road trip that way -- I've done it -- it will just be at a more relaxed pace than an ICE car would allow.

Many Americans love the *idea* of road trips. If you are a person who *actually makes* frequent road trips, a PHEV is probably a better choice for you. If not, I recommend a BEV; in exchange for making road trips less convenient, you will almost never need to take it to the mechanic.

## Choosing an EV: Tesla vs. Everyone Else

Honestly, this depends on how much you care about culture war stuff. I think Elon Musk is kind of a noxious person, and that makes me like his stuff less, but in addition to that he seems kind of unstable in a way that makes Tesla less trustworthy as a company. 

To give a specific example: One of the big reasons you would consider buying a Tesla is that their "Supercharger" EV charging network is second to none. Superchargers are known for being rock-solid, easy to use, and generally making all the other EV chargers jealous. They're so good that a bunch of other car manufacturers are considering standardizing around the connector they use. 

Anyway, in May of 2024, Elon Musk [fired the entire Supercharger division](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/) because he was doing layoffs across the company and the guy in charge of Supercharger didn't lay off as many people as Musk said he should. This sent shockwaves throughout the industry, as people at other companies who were working to standardize around the Tesla connector and people who were working on building new Supercharger facilities suddenly had no-one to talk to. Musk eventually re-hired large portions of the Supercharger team after he got his way, but this behavior does not produce the stable, predictable relationship I want with my car manufacturer.

Musk has also been promising that Tesla cars will have Full Self-Driving capabilities "next year" [every year since 2014.](https://futurism.com/video-elon-musk-promising-self-driving-cars). 13 people (so far) who relied on Tesla Autopilot to keep them safe [have died](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/26/tesla-autopilot-fatal-crash). And there are general allegations of Tesla cutting corners with build quality, creating a ["Diversion Team"](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-batteries-range/) to sandbag customer complaints about unrealistic range estimates, and [lots of other stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Tesla,_Inc.)

I recognize that I'm not objective about this. They have lots of fans, and I'm told the experience is very polished. But when I went shopping for an EV, a Tesla wasn't what I wanted, and there are other good options.

### Leaf vs. Bolt

If you have loads of money to spend, the sky's the limit. You have dozens of options. But if you're not in the market for a luxury vehicle, the two most popular cars at the low end of the pricing scale are the Nissan Leaf and the Chevy Bolt. I recommend test-driving both.

The Leaf was the world's first mass-market EV all the way back in 2009. They made some decisions others have improved on. My biggest concern about the Leaf is that it uses an older charging connector called CHAdeMO; this connector is becoming less popular, and I am concerned that eventually it will become hard to find. Leaf batteries also don't have liquid cooling systems, instead relying on the surrounding air; this makes charging take a long time when it's hot out, and it can degrade the batteries over time. On the plus side, if you have a power outage, the Leaf's battery can [power the appliances in your home](https://www.inverse.com/input/tech/nissan-leaf-bidirectional-charging-vehicle-to-grid), potentially for several days.

The other popular choice is the Chevy Bolt. The Bolt comes in 2 variants: the Bolt EV and the Bolt EUV. The Bolt EUV is an SUV; the Bolt EV is a hatchback, and it's slightly smaller. Both are good, but my wife and I picked the EV. It's a solid all-around car with a good infotainment system and good safety features. They redesigned the infotainment system in 2022, and it was a big enough improvement that we didn't want to go back past that model year. It gets about 200 miles of range, and a DC fast-charger will get it back up to 80% in about an hour, after which charging slows down (as with most current EVs). I decided to get the 2LT trim, as that had some safety features I wanted, me being still traumatized by maniacal Dallas drivers.

_Consumer Reports_ gives the 2022 Chevy Bolt a poor rating for reliability. As far as I can tell this is because sometimes their batteries used to catch fire. Chevy recalled every Bolt ever built and replaced all their batteries, and now they work fine. It's my view that whether your product works perfectly the first time is less important than how well you take responsibility for your mistakes and make sure they get fixed. Chevy stood behind their product and gave all their customers new batteries (including new warranties); that gives me a lot of confidence that they'll continue to stand behind their cars in the future.

There is no 2024 Chevy Bolt. Chevy has discontinued the model while they rework it; the 2025 Bolt will use the new "Ultium" platform General Motors has developed for all of their EVs. The main thing we know about the '25 Bolt is that it will no longer use Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, which project music and driving directions from your phone into the car's infotainment system. Instead it will use Android Automotive, a Google-built OS that runs its own software and uses its own internet connection instead of using your phone. (It's not clear to me whether this separate internet connection will come with its own subscription fee.) I haven't used Android Automotive, but lots of people are unhappy about this decision. I think there's a strong case to be made that the 2022-23 Bolt vehicles may be the best affordable EVs on the market for some time.

### Protecting your investment

The flip side of a BEV being just a big battery and a pair of motors is that the battery is a big proportion of the car's value. If something kills the battery, the car is most likely totaled. 

The good news is that today's Chevy Bolt batteries last a very long time. We don't know exactly how long because none of them have worn out yet, but based on current rates of degradation they're expected to outlast the rest of the car.

I did read a story about someone who ran over a big piece of garbage on the road and wrecked his battery. That would be bad. Don't do that.

For my own peace of mind, I decided to buy my Bolt "pre-owned certified". This means it somes with a warranty // TODO

## Claiming your tax credit

In 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which (among many other things) aims to make the US a manufacturing hub for EVs. Toward this end, the US government will give you up to [$4000 toward the purchase of a used EV](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/used-clean-vehicle-credit), or [$7500 toward a new one](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/credits-for-new-clean-vehicles-purchased-in-2023-or-after). This has some qualifications - your income can't be too high, you can only claim it once every 3 years, and the vehicle must be built in America, among other things. But if you transfer the $4000 credit to the dealer, they can give you that amount off the vehicle's price up-front. Make sure you read the IRS rules linked above carefully; the dealer I talked to hadn't figured this process out yet and I had to be quite firm with them about following the rules to keep from losing my tax credit.

## Installing a charger

There are three "levels" of EV chargers. The higher the level, the faster the charge.

- **Level 1** is just plugging the car into a regular 120-volt wall outlet. This will take several days to get you to a full charge. Not the preferred way of doing things.
- **Level 2** chargers use 240 volts and will recharge your car in a few hours. This is the kind of charger you want installed at your home; it will easily recharge your car overnight.
- **Level 3** is DC fast charging. This can get your car from empty to 80% in about an hour. After that, charging slows down a lot as it gets harder to find places to pack the electrons into, so drivers will usually unplug at 80% and move on.

Level 1 charging takes too long to be practical; level 3 charging requires more electrical infrastructure than you want at your house. Level 2 chargers are the sweet spot that most EV owners will want.

Lots of vendors will sell you a level 2 charger. (Chevy will even give you one if you buy a Bolt new.) After asking around on Reddit, I ordered an Emporia charger which I've been very happy with. Emporia connected me to a local electrician who installed the charger for a reasonable rate. After six months, the charger died; Emporia immediately sent me a new one and paid for the electrician to swap it out. That's good customer service!

## Conclusion

I'm extremely happy with my EV. I never want to go back. You never realize how much time and money you waste at gas stations until you don't have to do it any more. I'm looking forward to a day when most cars are electric and there's no exhaust smell as you walk down a busy road.
