Hi, I'm James. I use the Web to make complex topics easy to understand.

I love figuring out how stories work, so I made the [Periodic Table of Storytelling](https://jamesharris.design/periodic/), an introduction to storytelling's basic building blocks. I also built [TaskFractal](https://taskfractal.com), a task tracker designed to help unravel knotty to-do lists and figure out what to work on next.

As a writer, I believe one of the worst things you can do is waste the reader's time. That means this blog goes long stretches without an update if I don't have anything worth saying. Please [subscribe via email](https://us17.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=de4bf90cba33682650d14d747&id=6e5b78ac2c) or [RSS](https://jamesharris.design/blog/feed.xml) to be notified when there's a new post.

I avoid Facebook and Twitter for my mental health, which limits my options for promoting this blog. If you found value in something I wrote, please share it with your friends!
