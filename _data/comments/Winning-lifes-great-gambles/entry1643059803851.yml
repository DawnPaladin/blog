message: "I enjoy your posts, James.  There is a lot of wisdom in this one.  I think it's worth adding a couple of codicils to these five points.\r\n\r\n1a:  In choosing best options, where matters of the heart are concerned, it's certainly true that the first person you fall for may not be your best choice soul-mate for life.  Dating widely but holding your heart in reserve as you do it is better than sleeping around widely, falling desperately in love with many people and then finally marrying someone.  When it comes to deep bonding, there's much to be said for keeping some of life's \"firsts\" for the person you spend the rest of your life with.  People who have no unique intimacies, unique experiences, no unshared with anyone else secrets, are not in the same class as people who have saved those gifts for one other person.  My experience has been that (generally) guys have a harder time grasping that as intuitively as gals do.  \r\n  \r\n4a: The beauty of original strategies is that they get you into the game.  If you're smart enough to stay nimble, once you're in the game, as you see circumstances (or at least your perspective of the landscape) changing, you surge away from whatever's working less and toward whatever will work better.  It's not that the original strategy was necessary a failure, it's just that they are designed for a context but must shift as the context changes.  \r\n4b: That said, there's such a thing as loyalty to include in all the calculating.  Sometimes, the person we marry gets gravely ill. Do we jettison them? What happens when our cute bride declines (looks-wise) from the original packaging? On to the next cutie?  Maybe if we're a schmuck, but not if we're all in and for life.  What if the guy we follow into business finds himself on the ropes? Do we think only of self or do we stand beside him to the bitter end?  Sometimes, the best life lived includes a good death.  If success is no longer all about me but rather all about us, then I've grown from individual to community member. I'm no longer an only child, I'm a family member.  I'm no longer a contract laborer, I'm a company man.  The trick is for you to figure out (by virtue) who is worth your loyalty and then show them by sacrifice that your loyalty has surpassing value.  \r\n\r\nThat's what I liked best about your post--that you end underscoring your values.  Strategies to win are okay, but values transcend expedience.  It's a good place to build a life on and a good hill to die on."
